Classification: Level 4 Restricted
📈 SECTION 01: BIOMETRIC MATHEMATICS
To build a cat, you have to calculate the cat. Use these for your physics engine.
1.1 The "Righting Reflex" Angular Momentum
When a cat falls, it rotates its body in mid-air. The conservation of angular momentum L is:


Where I is the moment of inertia and \omega is the angular velocity. To land on its feet, the cat changes its I by tucking its front paws, forcing a faster spin.
1.2 The Feline Jump Constant
A cat can jump 6x its own height. If h is the cat's height, the maximum vertical displacement \Delta y is:


To calculate the initial velocity v_0 required for this jump:


(Note: g \approx 9.8 \, m/s^2)
🧠 SECTION 02: NEURAL NETWORK TRAINING DATA
This is how we teach the AI to distinguish a "Cool Cat" from a "Regular Cat."
2.1 Training Parameters
 * Total Neurons in Cerebral Cortex: 250,000,000 (Twice as many as dogs).
 * Memory Retention: 10+ years (Emotional/Location-based).
 * Visual Sampling Rate: 250 degrees (Peripheral vision).

📊 SECTION 03: THE AGING ALGORITHM
Cats don't age like us. Their clock is non-linear. Use this function to calculate their "Dev Age."
| Cat Age (x) | Human Years (f(x)) | Logic |
|---|---|---|
| 1 Month | 1 Year | Rapid Bootup |
| 1 Year | 15 Years | Puberty/Adolescence |
| 2 Years | 24 Years | Prime Operating System |
| 2 + n Years | 24 + 4n | Stability Phase |
The Equation:
For any cat older than 2:

🛠 SECTION 04: RAW SENSOR DATA (WHISKERS)
Whiskers are basically high-frequency tactile sonar.
 * Frequency Range: Detects vibrations at 25–150 Hz.
 * Healing Property: A cat's purr frequency (25-150 Hz) is medically proven to improve bone density and heal tendons.
 * AI Implementation: We can use Fourier Transforms to analyze cat purrs for structural health monitoring.
🚀 SECTION 05: THE APPRENTICE CHALLENGE
Task ID: CAT_CRUNCH_01
 * Go to your src folder.
 * Write a script that takes a cat's weight (kg) and height (cm).
 * Calculate how much force (F=ma) they hit the ground with after a max-height jump.
 * If the force is > 50N, output: "WE NEED MORE CATNIP."
How to use this:
 * Tell him to grep through this file if he wants to find the jump constant.
 * Tell him this is his Source of Truth for the AI models he's building.
Would you like me to dump another 5,000 words of raw cat-behavioral data points and skeletal mapping coordinates into a second file for him?
